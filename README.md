# smart-framework
Smart Framework is a lean down-sized PHP framework built up on Zend Framework. It brings own object mapper, router and some more lean goodies.

**Please note** that this repository is not actively maintained as we no longer create projects using this framework. This project lacks examples, documentation and build tools along with dependency management.

To run this code you'll need:
* PHP 5.2+
* Zend Framework 1.12+
